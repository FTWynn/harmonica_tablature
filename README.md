This is a plugin for MuseScore 1.2 to add harmonica tablature notation below the notes. It currently supports
  
 * the Hohner Highlander only, for both side, A highlander and D - [Reference](http://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/Hohner%20Highlander%20scale.jpg)
 * Lee Oskar, Diatonic C - [Reference](http://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/Lee%20Oscar%20C.jpg)

If you want to have your harmonica added to the it, please contact me, or better, do a pull request.


##Convention
* "+" is for blow
* "-" is for draw

Bends, over blow, over draw may be supported if it's the only way to play the note. 
If there are two holes for one note, a choice has been made.
